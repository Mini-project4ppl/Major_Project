# INTRODUCTION <br>
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a progressive microvascular disorder that affects the
retina, leading to visual impairment and blindness among working-age adults in the
Western population. Itis the most common microvascular complication associated with
diabetes mellitus. Prolonged exposure to high blood glucose levels and metabolic
abnormalities contributes to the development and progression of DR. To prevent the
vision-threatening damage caused by DR, strict glycaemic control, early detection, and
appropriate management are essential. This study examines thepathogenesis, diagnosis,
and management of DR, emphasizing the collaborative efforts of an interprofessional
team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. By understanding the
underlying mechanisms, implementing timely interventions, and coordinating
comprehensive care,healthcare professionals can effectively address the challenges
posed by DR and improve patient outcomes.
